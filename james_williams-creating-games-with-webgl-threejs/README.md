# Creating Games with WebGL and Three.js   

My talk description
There was once a time where gaming in the browser meant Flash. That time
is no more. Based on OpenGL ES, WebGL brings the 3D world to the browser
without any plugins. Three.js, a scenegraph library for WebGL, allows us
to make creating 3D web apps easier by abstracting away many of the
low-level API calls.

In this session, youâll learn the basics of game programming,
WebGL, and how to use Three.js to create WebGL applications.
